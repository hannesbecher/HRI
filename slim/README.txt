Simuation parameter sets.
The parameters are listed in PKsfs/README.txt

Note the the subdiectories "paramsXX" of this directory have numbers offset by 1 compared to the names of the parameter sets in the manuscript. Our logic was that in the manuscript, the parameter sets should be counted starting from "1". But for historic reasons, the directory numbering starts from "02".
